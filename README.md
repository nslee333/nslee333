# Hey, I'm Nathan
  
 I'm a software engineer and community organizer based in Central Oregon.

 I do mostly backend development, play around with Linux, I've also founded and organize [Deschutes Tech Guild](https://www.meetup.com/deschutes-tech-guild/)

 I also offer mentorship in CS, Coding, Learning & Study, Time Management, and Freelancing. I charge for this knowledge and experience. If you're interested in hearing more please contact me via email.
