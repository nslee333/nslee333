Hello There!

  Iâ€™m Nathan Lee and I'm working on learning Blockchain Development with LearnWeb3DAO.
 

  ðŸ”— Iâ€™m working on learning Blockchain development with the Ethereum Ecosystem.
  
  ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TypesScript and Solidity with the LearnWeb3DAO.
  
  ðŸ“– When working on projects, I regularly document and explain the system structure and syntax that I don't know to myself to deepen my knowledge and understanding.
  
  ðŸ’¡ I'm working on learning not just how to build decentralized applications, but how to think of systems as a whole, and integrating that thinking into my problem solving, and using that mindset to build solutions to large problems.
  
  
  
  Check out my LW3 Repo - that's where the majority of Blockchain projects are located :)
