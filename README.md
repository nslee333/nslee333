Hello There!
  Iâ€™m Nathan Lee and I'm working on learning Blockchain Development with LearnWeb3DAO.
</br>
  ðŸ”— Iâ€™m working on learning Blockchain development with the Ethereum Ecosystem.
  ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript and Solidity with the LearnWeb3DAO.
  ðŸ’¡ I'm working on learning not just how to develop decentralized applications, but how to think of systems as a whole, and integrating that into my problem solving,       and using that mindset to developing solutions to large problems.
  ðŸ“– When working on projects, I regularly document and explain the system structure and syntax that I don't know to myself to deepen my knowledge and understanding.
  
  
  


  Check out my LW3 Repo - that's where the majority of Blockchain projects are located :)
