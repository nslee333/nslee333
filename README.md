# Hey, I'm Nathan
  
 I'm a full-stack software engineer and community organizer based in Central Oregon.

 I do mostly fullstack development, play around with Linux and help organize [Bend DevOps](https://benddevops.org/)

 If you're a software engineer or an entrepreneur I'd love to hear what you're working on, feel free to shoot me an email or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-lee-258b02132/).
