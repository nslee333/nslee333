# Hey, I'm Nathan
  
 I'm a full-stack web developer based in the Central Oregon area.

 I do mostly fullstack development, and I also play around with Linux a little.

 If you're a software engineer or an entrepreneur I'd love to hear what you're working on, feel free to shoot me an email or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-lee-258b02132/).
